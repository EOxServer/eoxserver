The MERIS test data is produced from the following ESA remote sensing data:
MERIS L1b sample data available at: http://earth.esa.int/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=4320

The following configuration is provided with the fixture "meris_data.json":
 * DatasetSeries (EOId: MER_FRS_1P) containing the 3 MERIS datasets with all 15 
   radiance bands encoded as uint16 values as well as the StitchedMosaic 
   described below.
 * StitchedMosaic (CoverageId: mosaic_MER_FRS_1P_RGB) containing the 3 MERIS 
   datasets reduced to RGB 8-bit
 
Thanks to the European Space Agency (ESA) for providing the MERIS sample data.
