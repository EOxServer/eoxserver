OGC Web Coverage Service Transaction (WCS-T) operation extension Implementation Standard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This extension of the WCS standard specifies an additional Transaction
operation that may optionally be implemented by WCS servers. This
Transaction operation allows clients to add, modify, and delete grid
coverages that are available from a WCS server. The Transaction
operation request references or includes the new or modified coverage
data, including all needed coverage metadata.

The WCS-T 1.1 standard is defined in OGC document 07-068r4.
