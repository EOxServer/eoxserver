	<remarks>Parameterized definition of 2D image coordinate reference systems with the origin at the center of the first pixel in the image file. This CRS definition can be used for any size image, since no image size is specified. 

This CRS definition is designed to be used for ungeorectified images, and is not expected to be used for a georectified image. This definition can be used for a georeferenced or ungeoreferenced image, where a georeferenced image CRS is associated with the coordinate Transformation(s) that georeference it. </remarks>
