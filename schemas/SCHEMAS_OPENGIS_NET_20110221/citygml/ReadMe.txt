CityGML 1.0 readme.txt
======================

OpenGIS(r) City Geography Markup Language Encoding Standard 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The CityGML standard is an OpenGISÂ® Encoding Standard for the
representation, storage and exchange of virtual 3D city and landscape
models. CityGML is implemented as an application schema of the Geography
Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3). 

The CityGML 1.0.0 standard is defined in the OGC document 08-007r1.

CityGML models both complex and georeferenced 3D vector data along with
the semantics associated with the data. In contrast to other 3D vector
formats, CityGML is based on a rich, general purpose information model
in addition to geometry and appearance information. For specific domain
areas, CityGML also provides an extension mechanism to enrich the data
with identifiable features under preservation of semantic
interoperability.
