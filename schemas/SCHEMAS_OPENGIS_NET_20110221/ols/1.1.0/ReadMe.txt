OpenGIS(r) OLS 1.1.0 - ReadMe.txt 
=================================

OpenGIS(r) Location Service (OpenLS) Implementation Standard: 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The OpenGIS(r) Open Location Services Interface Standard (OpenLS)
specifies interfaces that enable companies in the Location Based
Services (LBS) value chain to "hook up" and provide their pieces of
applications such as emergency response (E-911, for example), personal
navigator, traffic information service, proximity service, location
recall, mobile field service, travel directions, restaurant finder,
corporate asset locator, concierge, routing, vector map portrayal and
interaction, friend finder, and geography voice-graphics. These
applications are enabled by interfaces that implement OpenLS services
such as a Directory Service, Gateway Service, Geocoder Service,
Presentation (Map Portrayal) Service and others.

The OpenLS 1.1.0 standard is defined in the OGC document 05-016.
