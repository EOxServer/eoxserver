XML schemas used by EOxServer
=============================

This repository hosts a copy of the OGC schemas available from 
http://schemas.opengis.net as well as an excerpt of the W3 schemas from 
http://www.w3.org.

Additionally there are proposed changes as well as extensions to those XML 
schemas available.

These extensions include work in progress that are currently discussed in 
the relevant working groups of the OGC mainly the WCS.SWG and might change 
without notice. There is no guarantee whatsoever that these proposals will 
get officially adopted by OGC.
