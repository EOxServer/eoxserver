Asynchronous Task Processing - Developers Guide 
===============================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction 
------------

This guide is intended to help with the creation of applications using the
*Asynchronous Task Processing* subsystem of EOxServer. 

The first part is guiding creation of the simple task producer, i.e., an
application needing the asynchronous processing capabilities. 

The second part helps with creation of a task consumer, i.e., the part 
of code pulling tasks from the work queue and executing them. The task  
consumer is part of Asynchronous Task Processing Daemon. 

An overview of the ATP capabilities is presented in ":ref:`atp_sum`". The
database model used in by the ATP subsystem is described in ":ref:`ATP Data
Model`". The complete API reference can be found in
":mod:`eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker`".

Simple ATP Application
----------------------

Here in this section we will prepare step-by-step a simple demo application 
making use of the ATP subsystem. The complete application is available at
location:: 

    <EOxServer instal.dir.>/tools/atp_demo.py 

The prerequisite of starting the application is that the correct
path to the *EOxServer* installation and instance is set together with the
correct *Django* ``settings`` module. 

Initially the application must import the right python objects
from the :func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker` module::

    from eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker import \
        registerTaskType, enqueueTask, QueueFull, \
        getTaskStatusByIdentifier, getTaskResponse, deleteTaskByIdentifier

By this command we imported following
objects: i) task type registration function, ii) the task creation (enqueue)
subroutine, iii) an exception class risen in case of full task queue unable
to accept (most likely temporarily) new tasks, iv) task's status polling
subroutine, v) the response getter function and finally vi) the subroutine 
deleting an existing task. These are the ATP Python objects needed by our 
little demo application. 

Step 1 - Handler Subroutine 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's start with preparation of an example of subroutine to be executed -
handler subroutine. The example handler below sums sequence of numbers and
stores the result::

    def handler( taskStatus , input ) : 
        """ example ATP handler subroutine """
        sum = 0 
        # sum the values 
        for val in input : 
            try :
                sum += float( val ) 
            except ValueError: 
                # stop in case on ivalid input 
                taskStatus.setFailure("Input must be a sequence of numbers!") 
                return 
        # store the response and terminate 
        taskStatus.storeResponse( str(sum) )  

Any handler subroutine (see also
:func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.dummyHandler`) 
receives two parameters: i) an instance of the
:class:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.TaskStatus` class 
and an input parameter. The input parameter is set during the task creation and
can be any Python object serialisable by the ``pickle`` module. 

Step 2 - New Task Type Registration 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once we have prepared the handler subroutine we can register the task type 
to be performed by this subroutine::
    
    registerTaskType( "SequenceSum" , "tools.atp_demo.handler" , 60 , 600 , 3 ) 

The :func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.registerTaskType` subroutine
registers a new task type named "SequenceSum". Any task instance of this task
type will be processed by the ``handler`` subroutine. The handler subroutine 
is specified as importable module path. Any task instance not
processed by an ATPD within 60 seconds (measured from the moment the ATPD pulls
a task from the queue) is considered to be abandoned and it is automatically
re-enqueued for new processing. The number of the re-enqueue attempts is limited
to 3. Once a task instance is finished it will be stored for min. 10 minutes
(600 seconds) before it gets removed. 

Step 3 - Creating New Task  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the task handler has been registered as a new task type we can create a
task's instance::

    while True :
        try:
            enqueueTask( "SequenceSum" , "Task001" , (1,2,3,4,5) ) 
            break
        except QueueFull : # retry if queue full 
            print "QueueFull!"
            time.sleep( 5 )
    
The :func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.enqueueTask` creates a new
task instance "Task001" of task type "SequenceSum". The tuple ``(1,2,3,4,5)`` 
is the input to the handler subroutine. In case of full task queue 
new task cannot be accepted and the
:func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.QueueFull` is risen. 
Since we want the task to be enqueued a simple re-try loop must be employed. 

Step 4 - Polling the task status 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After task has been created enqueued for processing its status can be 
polled::

    while True :
        status = getTaskStatusByIdentifier( "SequenceSum" , "Task001" )
        print time.asctime() , "Status: " , status[1] 
        if status[1] in ( "FINISHED" , "FAILED" ) : break 
        time.sleep( 5 ) 

The task status is polled until the final status (``FINISHED`` or ``FAILED``) is
reached. The task must be identified by unique pair of task type and task
instance identifiers.

NOTE: The task instance is guaranteed to be unique for given task type
identifier, i.e., there might be two task with the same instance identifier but
different type identifier. 

Step 5 - Getting the logged task history 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The history of the task processing is logged and the log messages 
can be extracted by :func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.getTaskLog`
function:: 

    print "Processing history:"
    for rec in getTaskLog( "SequenceSum" , "Task001" ) :
        print "-" , rec[0] , "Status: " , rec[1][1] , "\t" , rec[2] 

This function returns list of log records sorted by time (older first).

Step 6 - Getting the task results 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the task has been finished the task response can be retrieved::

    if status[1] == "FINISHED" :
        print "Result: " , getTaskResponse( "SequenceSum" , "Task001" ) 

Step 7 - Removing the task  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, the result task is not needed any more and can be removed from DB::

    deleteTaskByIdentifier( "SequenceSum" , "Task001" ) 

Executing ATP Task 
------------------
 
In this section we will briefly describe all the steps necessary to pull and
execute task instance from the queue. As working example we encourage you the
source Python code of the ATPD located at:: 

    <EOxServer instal.dir.>/tools/asyncProcServer.py

The invocation of the ATP server is described in ":ref:`atp_sum`".

Initially the application must import the python objects
from the :mod:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker` module::

    from eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker import * 

For convenience we have made available whole content of the module. 

Pulling a task from queue 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ATPD is expected to pull task from the queue repeatedly. For simplicity 
we avoid the loop definition and we will rather focus on the loop body.
Following command pulls a list of tasks from queue::

    try:
        # get a pending task from the queue 
        taskIds = dequeueTask( SERVER_ID )
    except QueueEmpty : # no task to be processed 
        # wait some ammount of time 
        time.sleep( QUEUE_EMPTY_QUERY_DELAY )
        continue

This command tries to pull exactly one task at time from the DB queue but the 
applied mechanism of pulling does not guaranties that none or more than one 
task would be return. Thus the dequeuing function returns a list of tasks 
and the implementation must take this fact into account. Further, the dequeue 
function requires unique ATPD identifier (``SERVER_ID``). 

The :func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.dequeueTask` function 
changes automatically the status from ``ENQUEUED`` to ``SCHEDULED`` and 
log the state transition. The optional logging message can be provided. 


Task Execution  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case we have picked one of the pulled tasks and stored it to ``taskId``
variable we can proceed with the task execution::

    # create instance of TaskStatus class 
    pStatus = TaskStatus( taskId )
    try:
        # get task parameters and change status to STARTED
        requestType , requestID , requestHandler , inputs = startTask( taskId )
        # load the handler 
        module , _ , funct = requestHandler.rpartition(".")
        handler = getattr( __import__(module,fromlist=[funct]) , funct )
        # execute handler 
        handler( pStatus , inputs )
        # if no terminating status has been set do it right now 
        stopTaskSuccessIfNotFinished( taskId )
    except Exception as e :
        pStatus.setFailure( unicode(e) )

In order to execute the task couple of actions must be performed. First an
instance of the :class:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.TaskStatus` class
must be created. 

The parameters of the task (task type identifier, task instance identifier,
request handler and task inputs) must be retrieved by the
:func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.dequeueTask` function. 
The function also changes the status of the task from ``SCHEDULED`` to
``RUNNING`` and logs the state transition automatically. 

The handler "dot-path" must be split to module and function name and loaded
dynamically by the ``__import__()`` function. 

Once imported the handler function is executed passing the TaskStatus and inputs 
as the arguments. 

The handler function is allowed but not required to set the successful terminal 
state of the processing (``FINISHED``) and if not set it is done by the 
:func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.stopTaskSuccessIfNotFinished`
function. 

Obviously, the implementation must catch any possible Python exception and
record the failure (``try-except`` block). 

DB Cleanup 
^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the normal operation each ATPD implementation is responsible for
maintenance of the ATPD subsystem in a consistent state. Namely, i) the ATPD 
must repeatedly check for the abandoned "zombie" tasks and restart them by 
calling :func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.reenqueueZombieTasks` 
function and ii) the ATPD must remove DB records of the finished "retired" 
tasks by calling 
:func:`~eoxserver.resources.processes.tracker.deleteRetiredTasks` function.
