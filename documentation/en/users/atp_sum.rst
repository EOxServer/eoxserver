Asynchronous Task Processing 
============================

Introduction 
------------

The *Asynchronous Task Processing* (ATP) subsystem, as the name suggests,
extends the *EOxServer* functionality by the ability to process tasks
asynchronously, i.e., in background independently of the default *EOxServer's*
synchronous client request processing.

Although the ATP subsystem is primarily designed to support asynchronous 
request processing of OGC Web Services such as the Web Coverage Service 
transaction extension (WCS-T) and/or the Web Processing Service (WPS), it is 
not limited to these and other parts of *EOxServer* may use it as well. 

The ATP subsystem employs the model of a single shared task queue and one or 
more *Asynchronous Task Processing Daemons* (APTD) executing the pending 
tasks pulled from the task queue. A single ATPD is not restricted to a 
single processed task at time and it can internally process multiple tasks 
concurrently, e.g., by employing a pool of parallel worker threads assigned 
to multiple CPU cores. 

The ATP subsystem is implemented as Django application using a DB model as the
task queue. Although the underlying DB storage may be seen as suboptimal in
terms of performance and latency it assures tolerance of the subsystem to
possible failures or maintenance shut-downs of both *EOxServer* and/or APTDs. 

Tasks
-----

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the correct operation of the ATP subsystem it is essential to understand the
concept of a *task* and its life-cycle. 

A *task* is an atomic and isolated action (amount of work) to be performed 
by *EOxServer*. When created, each task has a handler subroutine (python 
code to be executed) and a set of task specific input parameters to be 
processed by the handler subroutine. When finished, the tasks produce 
outputs. 

The tasks may be created by different applications (*EOxServer's* apps and
services). The tasks sharing the same handler subroutine and generic parameters
belong to the same task *type*.

The ATP is expected to be shared by multiple applications. APTDs pull the tasks
from the shared queue in First-In-First-Out fashion (regardless of the task
type) and execute the given handler subroutines. Significant benefit of this
shared nature of the APT subsystem is the control over the processing resources
(pool of workers) and isolation of the execution details from the application
(isolated from details such as the number of ATPD and working threads). 

Life-cycle
^^^^^^^^^^

The life-cycle of an asynchronous task, i.e., its possible states and state
transitions are displayed in Fig.3.

   *Fig.1: ATP Task State Diagram*

Any existing task can be in one of the following states: 

 * ACCEPTED  - a new enqueued task waiting to be pulled by an ATPD (initial
   state)
 * SCHEDULED - a task pulled (dequeued) by an ATPD but not yet started
 * RUNNING   - a task being processed by an ATPD
 * PAUSED    - a task which has been put on hold and which is waiting to be 
   resumed
 * FINISHED  - a task which has been finished successfully (terminal state)
 * FAILED    - a task which has been finished by a failure (terminal state)

When a task is created and enqueued for processing (ACCEPTED) it is stored in
the DB task queue waiting for an ATPD to pull the task out. In this state, it is
safely stored and protected against failures and shut-downs of both of the
producer (ATPD can access the DB) and of the ATPD (producer can access the DB).

When a task is in one of the intermediate states (SCHEDULED, RUNNING, or 
PAUSED) it is being processed by an ATPD and it is vulnerable to possible 
failures. In these states, any unexpected crash of the ATPD could leave a 
task in an intermediate state forever. Therefore each task type has assigned 
a security time-out after which the task is considered to be abandoned and 
shall be re-enqueued for new processing (ACCEPTED). A task, however, can be 
re-enqueued for limited times (3 times by default). After the number of 
restarts has been exceeded the task will be rejected (FAILED). This 
mechanism ensures that no task would be abandoned unfinished after an 
occasional ATPD crash but also that a defective task would get stacked in 
the time-out loop. 

When a task is in one of the terminal states (FINISHED or FAILED) it is safely
stored in the DB. By default a terminated task will be stored forever, however,
it is possible to specify an task type specific time-out after which the
terminated tasks will be removed automatically. 

ATP Installation and Configuration
----------------------------------

There are no specific steps to install and configure the ATP subsystem except
the basic *EOxServer* installation and configuration. The ATP is tightly coupled
with *EOxServer* and works right out of box. 

To track the status of the executed tasks and view the stored outputs auxiliary
ATP HTML views can be enabled by adding following lines to the URL patterns
('url.py' configuration file) of the actual *EOxServer* instance::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',

        ... 

        (r'^process/status$', procViews.status ),
        (r'^process/status/(?P<requestType>[^/]{,64})/(?P<requestID>[^/]{,64})$', procViews.status ),
        (r'^process/task$', procViews.task ),
        (r'^process/response/(?P<requestType>[^/]{,64})/(?P<requestID>[^/]{,64})', procViews.response ),

        ... 
    )

ATP Operation 
-------------

The ATP operation requires at least one ATPD to be running. Currently, there 
is only one ATPD implemented in EOxServer. This ATPD uses multiple 
sub-processes to process the tasks concurrently. By default, the numbers of 
sub-processes equals the number of available CPU cores. This ATPD can be 
executed as follows::

    $ export PYTHONPATH=<EOxServer install.path>:<EOxServer instance path>
    $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=autotest.settings
    $ <EOxServer install.path>/tools/asyncProcServer.py

The ``PYTHONPATH`` and ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` values can be passed as

There is a demo application showing the running of the ATPD and the ATP as 
such available in the default EOxServer installation. This demo application 
can be executed as follows::

    $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=autotest.settings
    $ <EOxServer install.path>/atp_test.py

Performance considerations 
--------------------------
 
The ATP is designed for resource demanding longer running tasks (10 seconds and
more) which in case of a synchronous operation could clog the system or lead to
connection time-outs. On contrary, *light* tasks (less than 1 sec.) should
preferably be executed synchronously.
