The `Symposium on Service-Oriented Mapping 
<http://somap.cartography.at/?SOMAP_2012>`_ aims to be a multidisciplinary 
event, spanning from computer science to geobusiness. The aim is to bring 
together various stakeholders in the area of Service-Oriented mapping (data 
producers, mapping agencies and companies, infrastructure providers, 
software developers, cartographers, artists, ...) in order to discuss the 
influence of this new production environment (the networked spatial 
infrastructure and its service-oriented distribution) on the map production 
and the perspectives of the new paradigm for research and development in 
cartography.
