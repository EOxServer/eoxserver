  +-----------+------------------+---------------------------------------------+

The Python bindings of the GDAL, MapServer (MapScript) and libxml2 libraries are
required as well. 

EOxServer is written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and uses the
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_ framework which requires a
Python version from 2.5 to 2.7. Due to backwards incompatibilities in Python
3.0, Django and thus EOxServer does not currently work with Python 3.0.

EOxServer makes heavy usage of the `OSGeo <http://osgeo.org>`_ projects
`GDAL <http://www.gdal.org>`_ and `MapServer <http://mapserver.org>`_.

EOxServer also requires a database to store its internal data objects. Since it
is built on Django, EOxServer is mostly database agnostic, which means you can
choose from various database systems. Since EOxServer requires the database to
have geospatial enablement, the according extensions to that database have to
be installed. We suggest you use one of the following:

 * For testing environments or small amounts of data, the `SQLite
   <http://sqlite.org/>`_ database provides a lightweight and easy-to-use
   system.
 * However, if you'd like to work with a "large" database engine in an
   operational environment we recommend installing `PostgreSQL
   <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_.

For more and detailed information about database backends please refer to
`Django database notes <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/databases/>`_
and `GeoDjango installation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/gis/install/>`_.

Installing EOxServer
--------------------

There are several easy options to install EOxServer:

* Install an official release of EOxServer, the best approach for users who
  want a stable version and aren't concerned about running a slightly older
  version of EOxServer. You can install EOxServer either from

  * `PyPI - the Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ using
    `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html>`_::

      sudo pip install eoxserver

  * or from the `EOxServer release page <https://github.com/EOxServer/eoxserver/releases>`_
    using pip::

      sudo pip install https://github.com/EOxServer/eoxserver/releases/download/release-<version>/EOxServer-<version>.tar.gz

    or manually::

      wget https://github.com/EOxServer/eoxserver/releases/download/release-<version>/EOxServer-<version>.tar.gz .
      tar xvfz EOxServer-<version>.tar.gz
      cd EOxServer-<version>
      sudo python setup.py install

  * or binaries provided by your operating system distribution e.g. 
    :ref:`CentOS <CentOSInstallation>`.

* Install the latest development version, the best option for users who
  want the latest-and-greatest features and aren't afraid of running
  brand-new code. Make sure you have `git
  <http://git-scm.com/>`_ installed and install EOxServer's
  main development branch using pip::

    sudo pip install git+https://github.com/EOxServer/eoxserver.git

  or manually::

    mkdir eoxserver_git
    git clone git@github.com:EOxServer/eoxserver.git eoxserver_git
    cd eoxserver_git
    sudo python setup.py install

If the directory EOxServer is installed to is not on the Python path, you will
have to configure the deployed instances accordingly, see
:ref:`EOxServer Deployment` below.

The successful installation of EOxServer can be tested using the
:ref:`autotest instance <Autotest>` which is described in more detail in the
:ref:`EOxServer Developers' Guide`.

.. index::
    single: EOxServer Instance Creation
    single: Instance Creation

Now that EOxServer is properly installed the next step is to :ref:`create and
configure a service instance <InstanceCreation>`. 

Upgrading EOxServer
-------------------

To upgrade an existing installation of EOxServer simply add the `--upgrade`
switch to your pip command e.g.::

  sudo pip install --upgrade eoxserver

or rerun the manual installation as explained above.

Please carefully follow the :ref:`migration/update procedure <Migration>` 
corresponding to your version numbers for any configured EOxServer instances 
in case of a major version upgrade.


.. _hardware_guidelines:

Hardware Guidelines
-------------------

EOxServer has been deployed on a variety of different computers and virtual
machines with commonplace hardware configurations. The typical setup is:

* a dual-core or quad-core CPU
* 1 to 4 GB of RAM

The image processing operations required for certain OGC Web Service requests
(subsetting, reprojection, resampling) may be quite expensive in terms of
CPU load and memory consumption, so adding more RAM or an additional core (for
VMs) may increase the performance of the service. Bear in mind however, that
disk I/O speed is often a bottleneck.
