SOAP Access to WCS
------------------

SOAP access to services provided by EOxServer is possible if the functionality
is installed by the service provider. The protocol is SOAP 1.2 over HTTP.

EOxServer responds to the following WCS-EO requests via its SOAP service interface:

* DescribeCoverage
* DescribeEOCoverageSet
* GetCapabilities
* GetCoverage

To access the EOxServer by means of SOAP requests, you need to obtain the
access ULR from the service provider.
For machine readable configuration the SOAP service exposes the WSDL
configuration file: given a service address of 'http://example.org/eo_wcs' the
corresponding WSDL file may be downloaded at the URL
'http://example.org/eo_wcs?wsdl'.

Installation
------------

A quick-intall quide is provided below.  For a full installation guide see the
INSTALL file in the source tree.

Quick installation guide for EOxServer on CentOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Prerequisites:
.................

* :ref:`EOxServer <Installation>` installed and configured, including 
  MapServer and Apache HTTP Server
* Add the yum repository as described in the :ref:`CentOSInstallation` 
  available at http://packages.eox.at (recommended) or directoy obtain the 
  RPM packages from http://yum.packages.eox.at/el/6/testing/x86_64/.

1. Basic install:
.................

The following standard installation sets up soap_proxy for an installed eoxserver
service accessible at http://127.0.0.1/eoxserver/ows

**Caution:** if upgrading an existing installation of soap_proxy, please be
sure to make a backup of the directory
`/usr/share/axis2c_eo/services/soapProxy`. The eo_soap_proxy-1.0.1-1 package
does not correctly preserve this directory duing upgrading.

Via the repository::

  sudo yum install axis2c_eo eo_soap_proxy
  sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart

or the packages::

  sudo rpm -i axis2c_eo-1.6.0-3.x86_64.rpm
  sudo rpm -i eo_soap_proxy-1.0.1-1.x86_64.rpm
  sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart

2. Test:
........

To test open a webbrowser to the page:

  http://<your_server>/sp_eowcs?wsdl

You should see the wsdl.

Further testing may be done via soapui.  See the file 
``soap_proxy/test/README.txt`` in the source tree.


3. Add another service:
.......................

To add another service to the basic installation, perform the following steps
as root:

By way of example let us say our new soap_proxy service shall be available at
http://example.org/sp_foo, and the corresponding backend eoxserver is
accessible at  http://127.0.0.1/eoxs_foo

First, in the directory ``/usr/local/share/axis2c/services`` recursively copy
the subdirectory ``soapProxy`` to ``soapFoo``::

  cp -r soapProxy soapFoo
  cd soapFoo

In ``soapFoo`` rename ``libsoapProxy.so`` and ``soapProxy.wsdl``::

  mv libsoapProxy.so libsoapFoo.so
  mv soapProxy.wsdl soapFoo.wsdl

Note that if selinux is enabled you may need adjust the object type of
``libsoapFoo.so``.

edit ``soapFoo.wsdl`` - at the bottom of the file chage  ``soap:address location``
to the new endpoint::

  <soap:address location="http://example.org/sp_foo"/>

edit ``services.xml`` - change ServiceClass, BackendURL, and SOAPOperationsURL::

  <parameter name="ServiceClass" locked="xsd:false">soapFoo</parameter>
  <parameter name="BackendURL">http://127.0.0.1/eoxs_foo/ows</parameter>
  <parameter name="SOAPOperationsURL">http://example.org/sp_foo</parameter>

Optionally, you may consider updating the ``<description>``.

Edit the file ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/030_axis2c.conf``:  In the block ``<IfModule
mod_proxy.c>``, add 'ProxyPass' and 'ProxyPassReverse' lines corresponding to
your new service::

  ProxyPass         /sp_foo  http://127.0.0.1/sp_axis/services/soapFoo
  ProxyPassReverse  /sp_foo  http://127.0.0.1/sp_axis/services/soapFoo


Old installation guide without rpms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Prerequisites:
.................
The following is required before you can proceed with installing soap_proxy:

* ``mapserver`` installed & configured.
* Apache ``httpd`` server(``httpd2`` on some systems) installed and running
* ``eoxserver`` is optional

1. Old Non-rpm installation
...........................

This is suitable for general installation e.g. if you are not using
eoxerver but wish to use mapserver direcly.

**Warning**: some of the configuration details are out of date, but
the changes are not structural.

Also see the INSTALL file in the source tree.

Download from http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/download.cgi

Make a directory for the code::

    cd someplace
    mkdir axis2c
    setenv AXIS2C_HOME /path/to/someplace/axis2c

Follow the instructions in 'doc' to compile, and use something like the
following configure line to get ``mod_axis2`` configured for compiling at the same
time::

   ./configure --with-apache2="/usr/include/apache2" \
     --with-apr="/usr/include/apr-1" --prefix=${AXIS2C_HOME}

Execute the standard sequence::

   make
   make install

Copy ``lib/libmod_axis2.so.0.6.0``  to ``<apache2 modules directory>``  as
``mod_axis2.so``. 

Edit the file ``${AXIS2C_HOME}/axis2.xml`` and ensure that the parameter
enableMTOM has the value ``true``.

Check that the following directory exits, if not create it:
   ``${AXIS2C_HOME}/services``


2. Deploy axis2 via your webserver
..................................

Configure ``mod_axis2`` in the apache server config file. On Suse Linux one might
edit the file ``/etc/apache2/default-server.conf``.

Set up a proxy::

  <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPass         /sp_wcs   http://127.0.0.1/o3s_axis/services/soapProxy
    ProxyPassReverse  /sp_wcs   http://127.0.0.1/o3s_axis/services/soapProxy
    ...
    <Proxy *>
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
      ...
    </Proxy>
  </IfModule>

and deploy axis2::

    LoadModule axis2_module  /usr/lib64/apache2/mod_axis2.so
    Axis2RepoPath /path/to/AXIS2C_HOME
    Axis2LogFile /tmp/ax2logs
    Axis2MaxLogFileSize 204800
    Axis2LogLevel info
    <Location /o3s_axis>
        SetHandler axis2_module
    </Location>


3. Verify the deployment of axis2
.................................

Resart the webserver (``httpd2``) and open the following page::

 http://127.0.0.1/o3s_axis/services

You should get a page that displays the text "Deployed Services" and is otherwise blank.


4. Configure and Compile Soap Proxy.
....................................

Change your working directory to the service directory in the soap_proxy source
code::

 cd <...>/soap_proxy/service

In ``soapProxy.wsdl`` set ``<soap:address location=.../>``.  Copy
TEMLATE_services.xml to ``services.xml``.
In ``services.xml`` set ``BackendURL`` to the address of eoxserver.

Now change to the src directory::

 cd src

In your environment or in the ``Makefile`` set ``AXIS2C_HOME`` appropriately, and
execute::

 make inst

Restart you httpd server and check that http://127.0.0.1/o3s_axis/services
shows the soapProxy service offering the four EO-WCS operations.

Further testing may be done via soapui.  See the file 
``soap_proxy/test/README.txt`` in the source tree.
