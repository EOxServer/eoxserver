======================

OpenGIS(r) City Geography Markup Language Encoding Standard 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The CityGML standard is an OpenGIS(r) Encoding Standard for the
representation, storage and exchange of virtual 3D city and landscape
models. CityGML is implemented as an application schema of the Geography
Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3). 

The CityGML 1.0.0 standard is defined in the OGC document 08-007r1.

CityGML models both complex and georeferenced 3D vector data along with
the semantics associated with the data. In contrast to other 3D vector
formats, CityGML is based on a rich, general purpose information model
in addition to geometry and appearance information. For specific domain
areas, CityGML also provides an extension mechanism to enrich the data
with identifiable features under preservation of semantic
interoperability.

Where are the codelists?

The codelists for the values of enumerative attributes like "class", 
"function", "usage" etc. do not belong to the normative part of the 
CityGML specification, because these typically will require different
values for different countries. The codelists provided in the 
specification document are to be considered as an example for the 
definition of appropriate codelists. Since they have been defined by 
the SIG 3D they can be found in (and used from) the following 
repository
  http://www.sig3d.de/codelists/standard/
  
The codelists have therefore been deleted from the OGC Schema
repository. A zip archive containing the codelists that were shipped 
as examples with CityGML 1.0 can however still be downloaded from
  http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/codelists/
