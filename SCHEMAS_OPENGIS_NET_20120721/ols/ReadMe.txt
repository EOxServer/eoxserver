-- [ VERSION NOTES ] --------------------------------------------------

  OGC is incrementally changing how schemas will be hosted. A new
  revision of the Specification Best Practice policy document (06-135r11)
  clarifies this practices.

  OGC is moving to host the schemas using a 2 digit version number so
  that dependent documents (schemas) will not have to change each time a
  schema is corrected (by a corrigendum). The schemas actual version
  number will be kept in the version attribute on the schema element
  which will be used to signify that there has been a change to the
  schema. Each previous revision will be available online in a ZIP
  archive.
  
  The LATEST version is the M.N directory where 
   * M is the major version
   * N is the minor version
  The latest bugfix version now is always in the M.N directory and 
  documented in the version attribute on the schema element. The older
  versions are now archived in the -M_N_X.zip files.
  
  Previously the OGC used M.N.C where
   * M is the major version
   * N is the minor version
   * C is the corrigendum version
  These older M.N.C versions will be updated using M.N.C.X where 
  X may be a bugfix version. These schema will also be .zip archived.
